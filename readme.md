<!-- - Dot notations and Bracet notations -->

1Ô∏è‚É£ Dot Notation (.)

Definition:
Dot notation is used to access properties of an object using a literal name after a dot ..

Syntax:
object.property

Note: 
<!-- Example 1: -->

const person = {
    name: "Isha",
    age: 30
};

console.log(person.name); // Output: Isha
console.log(person.age);  // Output: 30


<!-- Example 2: -->

const car = {
    brand: "Toyota",
    model: "Corolla"
};

console.log(car.brand); // Toyota
console.log(car.model); // Corolla


Notes:
Simple and readable.

Only works if the property name is a valid identifier (no spaces, hyphens, or starting with a number).

2Ô∏è‚É£ Bracket Notation ([])

Definition:
Bracket notation is used to access properties of an object using a string inside square brackets.

Syntax:

object["property"]


Example 1:

const person = {
    name: "Isha",
    age: 30,
    "favorite color": "blue"
};

console.log(person["name"]);            // Isha
console.log(person["favorite color"]);  // blue


<!-- Example 2: -->

const car = {
    brand: "Toyota",
    model: "Corolla",
    "model year": 2020
};

console.log(car["model year"]); // 2020

<!-- A Array Methods in JavaScript -->
<!-- - array map, for each, filter, find, reduce difference between them? -->

‚úÖ Quick Summary

forEach: Just loop (no return).

map: New array with changed values.

filter: New array with selected values.

find: First matching value.

reduce: Single value result.

<!-- - class and object? -->

üîë Summary of Class & Object

Class ‚Üí A blueprint/template (like a recipe).

Object ‚Üí A real instance created from a class (like an actual cake made from the recipe).

Constructor ‚Üí Special method that runs automatically when making an object, used to set properties.

Methods ‚Üí Functions inside a class that describe behaviors of the object.

Each object created from a class is independent, but they all follow the same structure.


<!--- üîë Summary of Inheritance -->

Inheritance lets one class reuse code from another class.

extends ‚Üí Keyword to make child inherit parent.

super() ‚Üí Calls the parent constructor inside child class.

Parent methods can be used by child objects directly.

Child class can add new methods or override old ones.

üëâ This keeps code reusable, clean, and avoids duplication.

<!--note: Encapsulation & this in JavaScript -->
<!--- 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is Encapsulation? -->

Encapsulation means bundling properties and methods inside a class so they work together.

It also means restricting direct access to some data (so no one can mess with it from outside).

In JS, we use private fields (#) or conventions like _propertyName to make data hidden.

üëâ Think of it like a capsule: you can swallow the medicine (use the methods), but you can‚Äôt see or touch the raw powder inside (hidden properties).

<!--- 2Ô∏è‚É£ The this keyword -->

Inside a class or object, this refers to the current object.

It helps us access the properties and methods of that specific object.

If you make multiple objects from a class, this always points to the one that is currently running the method.
<!--- üîë Summary: Encapsulation & this -->

Encapsulation ‚Üí Hides internal details, allows control via methods.

Private fields (#property) ‚Üí Prevent direct access.

this ‚Üí Refers to the current object instance.

Helps keep code organized, safe, and reusable.
